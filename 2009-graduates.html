          Across from the overgrowth-outlined mobilehome and located just outside of the small town of Eddyville, IA exists a secret spot down by the river.<br><br>"We partied here for about eight years starting in eighth grade. [We had around] 80 plus people and huge bonfires." Jessie points upward near where the sun is breaking through the leaves, describing the height of the tallest fire he remembers.<br><br>The two of us sat on sawn-off tree stumps next to a cinder block surrounded burn pile filled with ash, twigs, and crushed solo cups.

          "I've been clean for about a year and a half now, after the house burned down."<br><br>Jessie opens up about the number of times he's overdosed, rendering him to a near death, as well as losing his best friend, and how both of these situations have influenced his idea of death.<br><br>Walking past the gravel road and through high grass, Jessie led me to an even more secluded area. There stood a teepee, one that he and his friends built some time ago.

          Mindy tells me that the four-wheeler is her escape from the everyday because it reminds her of a time when she was younger.<br><br>"I'm still at a point where I don't really know what I want to be when I grow up."<br><br>She mentions being bored with her life in its current state, but positively acknowledges that she's grown to be more open-minded and adventurous. She's in the process of re-considering a few things, including a move to Des Moines.<br><br>We spent a moment on the trampoline at her father's house just outside of University Park, IA and felt nostalgic for the summers we had stargazed on it. Not much else mattered at the time.

          Tony reflects on how he's changed for the better since high school and after the few months that were spent in prison. After being released, he started working at Kaldera, a Mediterranean restaurant down the street from where he lives in Pella, IA. He also began dating his first girlfriend, Lindsay.<br><br>"Back in the day, I would have considered this pussy-music," he says as we walk past the living room stereo system playing what I remember to be something from the Top 40s.
